# Configure framebuffers with "power-optimized" ram-decomposition.
#
# This affects how Vivado elaborates RAMs that are larger than a RAMB36: by default,
# it'll optimize for timing, which means splitting entries across multiple BRAMs.
# This is problematic if the number of rows isn't a power of two, because it'll waste
# a significant amount of space (e.g. a 240x160 framebuffer, with 38,400 15-bit entries,
# will end up using 30 BRAMs (each 1 bit x 32768) (with expansion).
#
# Power optimized decomposition will split rows across BRAMs, so the same framebuffer will
# use 19 BRAMs (each 15-bit x 2048) (depth expansion).
#
# -quiet prevents Vivado from complaining about get_cells returning nothing during implementation
# (since this is a synthesis-only directory). However, it also masks any errors due to the
# path actually being wrong in synthesis.
